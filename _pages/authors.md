# At the Workshop

For the workshop in July, we expect all authors of accepted papers to present their work in person. For this, we will provide 30 minute time slots for each presentation and suggest authors prepare 22 minute long talks to leave some room for discussion.

# Tutorial Participation

For those who will participate in the tutorials on Monday, we will provide detailed instructions regarding potential things to prepare ahead of time. In general, we will be working in python and R and discuss how to analyze systems using either analytical or simulative approaches in practice.

Details will follow soon.
